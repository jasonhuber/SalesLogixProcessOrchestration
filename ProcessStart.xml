    This file is used to configure the execution of workflows based on data events.

    
    <event name="{EVENT TYPE}">
        <entityType name="{ENTITY TYPE}" memberFilter="{PROPERTY LIST}">
            <runProcess name="{WORKFLOW NAME}" />
        </entityType>
    </event>
    <event ...>

	{EVENT TYPE} indicates the type of notification for which to run the configured workflows
		Created			=> Raise an event when a new entity is created
		Deleted			=> Raise an event when an existing entity is deleted
		PropertyChanged => Raise an event when an existing entity is updated, based on the subscribed properties in the memberFilter attribute

	{ENTITY TYPE} should be a fully qualified .NET type name indicating the entity to watch
	    1 or more <entityType> elements may be present.
	
	{PROPERTY LIST} is a comma separated list of properties on the {ENTITY TYPE} that are being watched for changes.
	    It is important to note that only properties mapped to database columns can be watched.  
		These entries are case sensitive.

	{WORKFLOW NAME} specifies the class name of the workflow to be executed.
	    1 or more <runProcess> elements may be present.
		The processLib.xml must be configured with the appropriate assembly which this workflow is contained within.
